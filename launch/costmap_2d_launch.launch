NOTE: You'll need to bring up something that publishes sensor data (see
rosstage), something that publishes a map (see map_server), and something to
visualize a costmap (see nav_view), to see things work.
Also, on a real robot, you'd want to set the "use_sim_time" parameter to false, or just not set it.
